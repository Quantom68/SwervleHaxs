// CLI wrapper around tools/patch-logic.mjs (the portable derive/patch core —
// see that file for the actual identifier-derivation regexes and the
// rationale behind the wildcarded-anchor approach).
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS RUNS ON GITHUB ACTIONS, NOT INSIDE THE EXTENSION
// ============================================================================
// Two earlier attempts tried to make the extension patch itself entirely at
// runtime, inside the browser:
//   1. Redirect swervle.com's script request to a `data:` URL built in
//      memory. Worked in one browser, but Chromium's redirect-safety rules
//      reject redirecting a script-destination request to `data:` in
//      others (confirmed: net::ERR_UNSAFE_REDIRECT in Brave) — inconsistent
//      across browsers, not something a config change fixes.
//   2. Redirect to a made-up `chrome-extension://` path and serve it
//      dynamically from the background service worker's own `fetch` event.
//      Also failed: a service worker only intercepts fetches from clients
//      IT CONTROLS (pages loaded from its own extension origin) — a
//      cross-origin redirect from an external page never reaches that
//      handler at all. `web_accessible_resources` only exposes REAL files
//      that exist in the package, with no hook for dynamic content.
// Conclusion: MV3 does not allow an extension to synthesize content for an
// external page without that content already existing as a real file
// somewhere reachable over plain https:// — full stop, not a bug to work
// around.
//
// So the actual fetch+derive+patch step now runs OUTSIDE any browser
// entirely, on a schedule, via GitHub Actions (see
// .github/workflows/repatch.yml) — which runs this exact script and commits
// patched-bundle.js/patched-terrainview.js/state.json when they change.
// Redirecting a `<script>` tag to a normal `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`
// URL is completely unrestricted (ordinary cross-origin script loading),
// which is what background.js in the extension itself now does — it only
// needs to know *which* live swervle.com filenames to intercept (from
// state.json, a few bytes) and points the ACTION at these fixed GitHub URLs,
// whose CONTENT updates independently, with no extension release needed.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/patch-bundle.mjs
//     Fetches everything live from swervle.com, writes
//     patched-bundle.js/patched-terrainview.js/state.json into this
//     directory (this is what the GitHub Actions workflow runs), and runs
//     the ESM-integrity self-check — a non-zero exit code here means the
//     workflow's own commit/push step is skipped, so a corrupted patch is
//     never published.
//
//   node tools/patch-bundle.mjs <main.js> <terrainview-chunk.js>
//     Offline mode: patches two already-downloaded files instead of
//     fetching, for local testing against a saved bundle. Doesn't write
//     state.json (the real hashes/filenames aren't meaningful offline).
// ============================================================================
